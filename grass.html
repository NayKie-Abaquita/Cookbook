        <h1> Korean Fried ice cream</h1>
          <img src= "fried-ice-cream-vs-20503-1.jpg" alt= "fried icream" width="350">
           <p> Description</p>
            <dl>This fried ice cream has a perfectly golden, warm, and crispy exterior plus a cold and creamy vanilla ice cream center.</dl>

             <p> Ingredients:</p>
             <ul>
               <li> This fried ice cream has a perfectly golden, warm, and crispy exterior plus a cold and creamy vanilla ice cream center.</li>
               <li> 2 cups panko</li>
               <li> 2 Eggs</li>
               <li> Neutral cooking oil for deep frying (vegetable oil, corn oil, or canola oil.)</li>
               <li> Toppings of your choice (e.g., chocolate/strawberry sauce, whipped cream, strawberries …)</li>
            </ul>

             <p> Instructions:</p>
             <ol>
               <li> Prepare a 1.5 qt box of your preferred ice cream (I used vanilla flavor). Using an ice cream scoop, divide the ice cream into 8 equal portions. Wrap each portion of ice cream with plastic food wrap, use your hands to shape them into balls or chicken drumstick shapes. Place the wrapped ice cream balls on a baking sheet and place them in the freezer for about 10 minutes.</li>
               <li> Add 1 cup of panko or breadcrumbs to a shallow plate. Take one frozen ice cream ball at a time, coat it thoroughly with the panko. Return the coated ball to the baking sheet in the freezer. Repeat this process for all of the ice cream balls.</li>
               <li> Place the coated ice cream balls back into the freezer and allow them to freeze overnight (or for a minimum of 4 hours) until they are completely solid.</li>
               <li> In shallow dish, beat 2 eggs. Add 1 cup of panko or breadcrumbs to another shallow dish.</li>
               <li> Take one frozen ice cream ball at a time, roll it in the beaten eggs, then coat it thoroughly with the panko. Place it back on the baking sheet in the freezer. Repeat for all the ice cream balls.</li>
               <li> In a medium pot, heat half pot of neutral cooking oil to around 355°F (180°C).</li>
               <li> Carefully place one coated ice cream ball in the hot oil. Fry the ice cream ball for about 10 to 15 seconds until it turns golden brown. (It is crucial to promptly remove the fried ice cream ball as soon as its surface turns golden brown, as the ice cream filling may melt rapidly in the hot oil. While frying this ice cream ball, ensure that you keep the remaining coated ice cream balls in the freezer to prevent them from melting while waiting.)</li>
               <li> Remove the fried ice cream balls from the oil using a spider strainer. Serve the fried ice cream ball immediately with toppings of your choice, such as chocolate or strawberry sauce, whipped cream, and fresh strawberries.</li>

        <h1> Strawberry cheesecake. </h1>
          <img src= "Strawberry-Cheesecake-3.jpg" alt= "strawberry cheesecake" width="350">
           <p> Description</p>
              
           <dl> This Strawberry Cheesecake is a stunner! Based on my classic Baked Cheesecake which I describe as a magically rich-yet-light, finished with a gorgeous strawberry topping that tastes as amazing as it looks.</dl>

           <p> Ingredients:</p>
           <ul>
            <li> 200g /28 Graham Cracker squares (Note 1)
                120 g / 8 tbsp unsalted butter , melted</li>
                <li> 1 lb / 500g cream cheese , softened (Note 2)
                <li> 2 tbsp plain flour (all purpose flour)</li>
                <li> 1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li> 1/2 cup sour cream (full fat, sub sour cream)</li>
                <li> 1 1/2 cups caster sugar (superfine sugar)</li>
                <li> Zest of 1 lemon</li>
                <li> 3 eggs , at room temperature</li>
                <li> 500g / 1 lb strawberries , half diced and half halved</li>
                <li> 2 tbsp lemon juice OR water (Note 3)</li>
                <li> 1/2 cup white sugar</li>
                <li> 1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li> 1 1/2 tsp cornflour/cornstarch</li>
                <li> 2 tbsp water</li>
           </ul>
           <p> Instructions:</p>
             <ol>
                <li> Preheat oven to 160C/320F (standard) or 140C/295F (fan/convection).</li>
                <li> Get a 20cm/8″ springform cake tin. Turn the base UPSIDE DOWN (Note 4), butter lightly and place a square piece of parchment/baking paper on the base. Then clip into the springform pan – excess paper will stick out</li>
                <li> Butter and line the side of the pan.</li>
                <li> Break up biscuits roughly by hand and place in a food processor.</li>
                <li> Blitz until fine crumbs (Note 5). Add butter, briefly blitz until dispersed and it resembles wet sand.</li>
                <li> Pour into the prepared cake tin. Use a spatula to roughly spread it out over the base and up the walls.</li>
                <li> Use something with a flat base and vertical edges (I used a measuring cup) to press the crumbs up the wall almost to the top of the sides, and flatten the base.</li>
                <li> Use a mixer or beater to beat the cream cheese until just smooth, no longer than 20 seconds on speed 4. (You do not want to aerate cheesecake filling as it causes cracks when it bakes)</li>
                <li> Add flour, beat for 5 seconds on speed 4 until just incorporated.</li>
                <li> Add vanilla, sour cream, sugar and lemon zest. Beat until just combined (10 sec max, speed 5).</li>
                <li> Add eggs one at a time, beat in between until just combined (5 sec each), and after the last one, beat just until the egg is fully incorporated.</li>
                <li> Pour into prepared crust.</li>
                <li> Bake for 55 minutes. The top should be a very light golden brown, not cracked, and near perfectly flat. It should jiggle slightly when you gently shake the pan.</li>
                <li> Cool the cake in the oven with the door open 20 cm / 8″ (Note 6), then refrigerate for 4 hours+ in the pan.</li>
                <li> Remove sides. Use overhang paper to slide cheesecake off the cake pan. Then slide the cheesecake off the paper.</li>
                <li> Place chopped strawberries, vanilla, sugar and lemon juices in a saucepan. Stir then bring to simmer over medium heat.</li>
                <li> Simmer for 10 minutes until strawberries breakdown.</li>
                <li> Mix cornflour with water, then add into saucepan and stir.</li>
                <li> Add halved strawberries and cook for 1 minute to soften.</li>
                <li> Sauce should be syrupy – remove from stove and cool. Will thicken as it cools.</li>
                <li> Once cool, stirl. Adjust thickness to make it the right “oozing” consistency (see video, Note 7) with a tiny touch of water (be careful!).</li>
                <li> Spoon onto cheesecake so it’s covered with a single layer of strawberries. Flip strawberry halves so they are facedown. Refrigerate 2 hours+.</li>
                <li> Slice and serve with remaining Strawberry Sauce!</li>

           <p> Description</p>

           <dl> This three-layer sunset cake is pretty enough for company, but it's so simple to make that you'll find yourself baking it often. A boxed mix keeps it convenient while the fruity filling makes it a crowd-pleaser. —Kara De la Vega, Suisun City, California.</dl>

           <ul>
            <li> 1 package white or orange cake mix (regular size)</li>
            <li> 1-1/2 cups 2% milk</li>
            <li> 1 package (3.4 ounces) instant vanilla pudding mix</li>

            <li> In a large bowl, combine the pineapple, sugar, 3-1/2 cups coconut and sour cream. Set aside 1 cup for frosting. Place 1 cake on a serving plate; top with half the remaining pineapple mixture. Repeat layers once; top with remaining cake.</li>
            <li> Fold whipped topping into the reserved pineapple mixture. Spread over top and side of cake. If desired, top with additional coconut, sliced pineapple, orange slices and mint. Refrigerate until serving.</li>

                      <dl> These Fluffy Japanese Soufflé Pancakes are like eating cottony clouds, but even better with homemade whipped cream and fresh berries! Read my best tips in this recipe and learn how to make them perfectly.</dl>

                      <p> Ingredients:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li> 2 egg yolks</li>
                        <li> 15 g milk</li>
                        <li> 1/4 tsp vanilla</li>
                        <li> 33 g all purpose flour</li>
                        <li> 4 g baking powder</li>
                        <li> 3 egg whites</li>
                        <li> 50 g sugar</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p> Instructions:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li> For the recipe, you’ll need two egg yolks and 3 egg whites in separate bowls. To the yolks add in 15 grams of milk and 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract and stir to combine.</li>
                        <li> For the dry ingredients. Measure 33 grams of all purpose flour and 4 grams of baking powder. Then sift into the wet ingredients. Stir this all together until smooth.</li>
                        <li> Take the three egg whites from earlier and whisk them until they light and fluffy at the soft peak stage. Measure 50 grams of sugar and add to the whipped whites. Whip until the whites are stiff peaks. This is super important, the meringue needs to be very firm or the batter will be too runny.</li>
                        <li> Gently Fold the meringue into the yolk and flour mixture in three additions trying not to knock out too much air. We want the batter to be fluffy and light. I tried different methods of adding the batter to the pan and using a piping bag is best. You need to use a non stick pan on low heat and make sure it is well greased with a neutral cooking oil.</li>
                        <li> When you pipe the batter in the pan focus on piping the mixture high rather than wide. The batter will spread slightly on its own. Another note is this batter is best when cooked immediately so if you can get multiple pans on at once so you can all the batter in one go this will yield the best results.</li>
                        <li> Pour a small amount of water in the pan and then cover with a lid. I cooked mine for about 5 minutes on low but yours might need more or less time depending on your stove. You’ll know that the pancakes are ready to be flipped when the batter is matte like this not sticky to the touch. Gently flip the pancakes, add in another splash of water and cover until cooked through.</li>
                        <li> I cooked mine on this side for another five minutes. The pancakes are done when they’re firm and springy to the touch. It’s best to serve them right away at the peak of their fluffiness. As they sit they start to deflate like mine have here a bit. Serve with whatever pancake toppings you please. I wasn’t sure if I would like the taste of these but they’re actually really nice almost like angel food cake. They’re really delicately sweet and of course have a nice light texture.</li>

                                <li> 2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                                <li> 1/3 cup cocoa powder</li>
                                <li> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                                <li> 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                                <li> For the coating: 1/2 cup granulated sugar
                                    1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
                               </ul>

                               <p> Instructions:</p>
                               <ol>
                                <li> Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.</li>
                                <li> Cream the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Scrape down the bowl and add the eggs one at a time, beating between each addition. Add the vanilla and red food coloring, and mix well.</li>
                                <li> In a separate bowl sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt to combine. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and beat together until combined.</li>
                                <li> Fill one bowl with granulated sugar and one bowl with powdered sugar. Use a 1 ounce cookie scoop (or tablespoon) to scoop cookies out. Roll the balls first in the granulated sugar and then in the powdered sugar to completely coat the cookie balls. Place on the prepared cookie sheet an inch apart. Bake for 10 minutes or until the cookies have puffed up and cracked, but are still a little gooey in the center.</li>
                                <li> Allow to cool and enjoy with a glass of milk!</li>

                               <dl> This easy brownie recipe takes about 30 minutes to make from start to finish for a chocolaty treat!</dl>

                               <p> Ingredients:</p>
                               <ul>
                                <li> · Sugar: These easy brownies start with two cups of white sugar.</li>
                                <li> · Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure in the batter.</li>
                                <li> · Butter: Two sticks of melted butter give the brownies moisture and richness.</li>
                                <li> · Eggs: Eggs lend even more moisture. Plus, they help bind the batter together.</li>
                                <li> · Cocoa powder: Of course, you'll need cocoa powder for chocolate brownies!</li>
                                <li> · Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the brownies.</li>
                                <li> · Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the brownies rise.</li>
                                <li> · Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
                                <li> · Walnuts: Nuts are optional, of course, but they add a welcome crunch.</li>

                               <p> Description</p>

                               <dl> This easy cherry pie recipe is made from scratch with 8 ingredients! A fresh cherry pie filling is baked between two layers of homemade pie crust for a delicious dessert, best served, a la mode of course. </dl>

                               <p> Ingredients:</p>
                               <ul>
                                <li> Pie crust. I give instructions on how to make a double all butter pie crust in this post as well as in the recipe card. You can use store bought, if preferred. </li>
                                <li> Sweet Cherries:  I recommend using fresh, sweet cherries in this recipe. Use this cherry pitter to make using fresh cherries easier (my kids love helping with this). If you only have frozen cherries, thaw them first. 1 pound of fresh cherries equals about 1 ½ cups pitted, so you will need about 4 pounds of fresh cherries. 16 oz frozen cherries equals about 3 cups, so you will need 2 pounds frozen cherries. Or, try these recipes: strawberry pie, raspberry pie, blueberry pie and peach pie. </li>
                                <li> All-purpose flour: you can use an all-purpose gluten-free flour in the filling, as well as cornstarch or tapioca flour. </li>
                                <li> Granulated sugar: I prefer organic cane sugar, but regular white sugar or any other granulated sugar works well. </li>
                                <li> Lemon Juice. The acidity of the lemon juice really makes this cherry pie pop. I don’t recommend omitting it. </li>
                                <li> Vanilla extract. use pure vanilla extract for best results. </li>
                                <li> Egg wash. This is optional, but recommended for a golden-brown crust. You can simply brush heavy cream on the crust instead to help the sugar stick. </li>
                               </ul>

                               <p> Instructions:</p>
                               <ol>
                                <li> Make the Pie Crust
                                  When I make pie filled with fresh fruit (like peach pie, strawberry pie, blueberry pie, apple pie, etc.), I always opt for an all-butter pie crust. The rich, slightly sweet, salty, buttery flavor of the crust compliments the fruit so well.
                                  
                                   Whether you use a food processor or a pastry cutter, making this all-butter pie crust literally takes 5 minutes. It is easy and tastes so much better than the store-bought crusts.
                                  
                                   Just remember it needs an hour (at least) to chill in the refrigerator before using, so plan accordingly. </li>
                                  <li> Make the Cherry Pie Filling
                                    In a small bowl mix together granulated sugar, flour, cinnamon, and sea salt set aside.In a large bowl mix together cherries, lemon juice and vanilla. Add the dry mixture to the cherries and gently stir to combine. </li>
                                    <li> Assemble the Cherry Pie
                                      Pour the cherry mixture into the prepared pie crust. Then place the prepared top crust and on the top of the cherry filling. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and cream. Then, lightly brush the entire pie crust with the egg wash. Place a pie crust shield or aluminum foil over the outer crust of your pie to protect it from burning.

                                      Bake the cherry pie in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the filling begins to bubble and the crust/top is lightly browned. Remove shield in the last 10 minutes of baking if it doesn’t begin to brown under the shield)
                                      
                                      Place the baked pie on a wire rack to cool for at least 3 hours. </li>
                                      <li> Serve
                                        Serve this fresh cherry pie room temperature with a scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream or a dollop of homemade whipped cream. </li>
                               </ol>
